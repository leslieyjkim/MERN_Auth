## This is how to make a user authentication system using MERN stack. 
- MongoDB(database)
- Express.js(backend framework)
- React.js(frontend library using SPA(single page applications))
- Node.js(backend JS runtime environment)

## Feature
This authentication project will cover all the essential features you would expect in modern web applications including ;
- user registration : Users can sign up easily, and a warm welcome email is sent directly to their registered email address upon successful registration.
- user login & logout : Secure and reliable login/logout functionality, ensuring user sessions are managed effectively.
- email verification : Users are required to verify their email address to activate their account, adding an extra layer of security.
- password reset : A secure and user-friendly password reset feature using a six-digit One-Time Password (OTP), sent directly to the user's email.


* This authentication project is built with best practices in mind to provide an excellent foundation for web applications. Whether you're building a personal project or a professional-grade application, this system is designed to simplify the authentication process while maintaining security and scalability.

Feel free to clone this repository and explore the code to see how these features are implemented! ðŸš€
